# Ranking Battle Breakdown
## Introduction
**Ranking Battle** is the first section of Disc Fusion, with a **Budokai Tenkaichi 1 disc being the requirement** to play it.

Much like in that game, the gamemode consists of **99 opponents** that need to be fought in order to proceed.

Upon completing the mission, the ``#17's Scarf`` Z-Item will be unlocked.

## Challengers
Because **fighting 99 opponents takes forever**, there are **37 challengers** who will intervene with the mission.
A challenger has a **6554 out of 65535 chance (~10.0008%)** of appearing, **unless there are 10 opponents remaining**, 
in which case, no challengers will ever appear.

The game makes no checks on which challengers have already been fought, so **the same challenger can appear more than once**.

If the challenger is defeated, the player **moves up by 6 ranks.**
Otherwise, the player stays where they are, and will fight either **the next opponent in line** or **another challenger**.

Here is a list of all the challengers:
* Great Ape
* Pan
* Uub
* Master Roshi
