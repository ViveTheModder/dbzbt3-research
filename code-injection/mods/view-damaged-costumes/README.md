# View Damaged Costumes in Character Reference

Imported from DBZBT4 to DBZBT3, for both NTSC-U (USA) and NTSC-J (Japan) versions.

To view damaged costumes, after selecting the color/costume number, press Square.

In case your ISO has other changes made to its source code (in the ELF, dbzp.bin file or both), you can use a pnach to only make the needed changes in memory.

Otherwise, ignore the pnach file and replace ``dbzp.bin`` alongside the ELF (SLUS/SLPS) with the modified files.

## How to Install PNACH Files (PS2 Cheat Codes)
1. Copy the pnach file.
2. Go to your PCSX2 version's folder, and check the ``cheats`` folder.
3. Paste the file there.
3.1. If a pnach with the same file name is already present, open both pnach files in Notepad, 
take the contents from the new pnach (copy) and add them to the old pnach (paste).
