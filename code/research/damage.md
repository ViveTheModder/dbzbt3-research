# Damage
## Introduction
Damage refers to the **decrease in health** of either player.

Given the many sources (and counters) of damage, the game **has to prioritize**. This is not done through a priority list, but rather a series of **independent conditions**.

## List of Damage Modifiers
The modifiers are listed **in order of appearance**.

It is important to note that **stat modifiers** have different bounds **depending on the gamemode**. The **lower limit** is always -20 units (each unit is 2.5%), which translates to a **50% decrease**.

As for the **upper limit**, it is 20 units **(50% increase) in Duel Mode**, 40 units **(100% increase) for fusions**, and 50 units **(125% increase)** for any character **outside of Duel Mode**.
